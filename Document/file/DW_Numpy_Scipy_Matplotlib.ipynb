Instead, you should use \"vectorized\" built-in operations that can do the looping in a faster language or even pick a better algorithm.\n","\n","Python is similar.  _Numpy_ is the package that provides the means to do performant numerical calculations in Python.  If you've converted your problem into linear algebra and matrices, then _numpy_ will let you write it to run fast.\n","\n","**Why are Python arrays unsuitable for numerical computation?**\n","\n","There are two basic reasons why Python on its own is insufficient here:\n","  - _Data structure._  A Python list is a complicated thing. Just consider something like:\n","        \n","           x = [1, \"23\", BeautifulSoup(urllib2.urlopen(\"https://www.google.com/#q=4\")), 5]\n","    \n","    where x[0] and x[3] are numbers (of some sort), x[1] is a string, and x[2] is a complicated object.  If you're familiar with a low-level language like C, just imagine how this must be stored in memory: \n","    \n","    > In the typical Python implementation, this might be stored as a linked list of pointers to \"Python object\" data structures which in turn store what class the object is an instance of, a pointer to a dictionary (i.e. hash table) of instance variables, and a pointer to a dictionary of class variables.  This is reasonable for x[2], but for x[0] and x[3]...\n","    \n","  - _Typing and dispatch._  When we write `x[0] + x[3]`, what happens?  You can overload `+` for all sorts of purposes in Python, and the decision of exactly what `+` means happens at run-time by a dictionary lookup.  If you were term-wise adding two arrays, `x` and `y`, then because arrays can contain elements of different types this has to happen _for each term_.\n","\n","**What numpy does for us:**\n","\n","The basic thing that `numpy` does is avoid these two problems by using ordinary C-style arrays of integers, floating point numbers, etc., along with functions that operate on them intelligently. It also gives us C-style higher dimensional arrays.\n","\n","Note that C-style arrays are good for more than just quickly performing operations through Python; they're also good for talking to existing C and Fortran code. This interoperability explains why `numpy` matters to you even if you won't do any matrix computations by hand: many of the libraries that you _will_ want to use will use `numpy` arrays under the hood.\n","\n","![Numpy Array vs. Python List](images/Numpy_Array_Vs_Python_List.svg \"Numpy Array vs. Python List\")\n","[comment]: https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1qsm90ZnesvtRr0_Y_hpJag5nragWv4fmkmfpBZRbxCQ/edit"]},{"metadata":{"id":"gEBtnSu_4LfP","colab_type":"text"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Data types (the nouns):\n","\n","### `np.array`\n","This is a C-style array.
